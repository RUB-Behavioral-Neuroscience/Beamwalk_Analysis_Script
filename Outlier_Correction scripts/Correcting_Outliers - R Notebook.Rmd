#General procedure
#I know it is tedious to select every folder to correct one after another. I might change this in the future, but first I need to add some features to the main script (and possiblyfix some bugs). Also the outlier correction itself might need to be improved. 

source(choose.files(caption = "Choose the correcting data R script", multi = FALSE)) #You could also change this to a fixed path to the file to make the progress go faster, just make sure to include \\ like her "D:\\Meine Downloads\\filename.fileextension"

video_file_extension <- ".mts" #Change this to .mp4, .avi or other file types the videos are encoded in


data_dir <- choose.dir(caption = "Choose directory with data to be corrected")

rows_to_skip_inside_csv_file <- 3L #Open a filtered uncorrected .csv file with the default windows editor. Count the rows until the first points of data then use that number here. The L indicates R that this will always be an integer.

###Nothing needs to be changed below here###

#data_dir
setwd(data_dir)

filenames <- gsub(pattern = "\\.csv$", "", list.files(path = data_dir, pattern = "*filtered.csv")) #filtered needs to be removed later on, but I didn't want to catch unfiltered ones, too. #|^corrected\\_

#filenames

names <- gsub(pattern = paste0("\\", video_file_extension, ".*?_filtered"), "", filenames, ignore.case = TRUE) #To remove the whole junk after the original file name attached by DeepLabCut. \\ ignores everything before the .mts and .*? removes everything between .mts and _filtered

#names

names <- gsub(pattern = "\\DLC_resnet.*?_filtered", "", names, ignore.case = TRUE) #Again everything before \\ is ignored and everything between (and including) DLC_resnet and _fitered will be removed. Both gsub() functions could also be nested, or you could also use a | between the patterns like "\\.mts.*?_filtered|\\DLC_resnet.*?_filtered"
